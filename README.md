Regalia is a generative, participatory and interactive artwork meant to let the audience be a part of the creation of the art itself. Using GANs and photo manipulation, I created the Insignias at the centre. The area around the Insignia is a playground where anyone can draw and complete the artwork. Regardless of skill levels, anyone can make amazing creations because of the use of symmetry. 

By clicking/tapping and drawing around the insignia different symmetrical patterns can be created. The final artwork can be downloaded by pressing enter/return key. Also, this page is linked to the layers of Regalia, i.e. based on the states of the different layers, the colour palette of the artwork, the central insignia, the planes of symmetry and the brush size changes. Thus, the owner of each layer controls the look and feel of the artwork and its creation process. 

I believe that a true artist starts by creating/curating his tools of creation. In the same spirit, many of my works hitherto have been on creating tools, digital or otherwise, and then using those tools to create art. Regalia is also created with the same concept in mind.

This artwork is hosted in the Async.Art website and is controlled using the updates which happen to the layers in the website:
